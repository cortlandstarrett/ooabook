 _- 04  min   Cort xxx      In the book, we will need to define terms
                            early on.  OOA, xtUML, Method, xUML, etc.  Let
                            us define the terms carefully, then use them
                            consistently.  This will be in the introduction 
                            of the book.  Raise an issue specifically for this
                            and assign to Cort.
