= tools directory

This directory is for documenting useful tools for contributors to the ooabook
project.

The format for the contents of this directory is:

- <toolname>.adoc

The contents of the <toolname>.adoc should describe the tool and include a URL
to where the tool can be obtained.

If the number of entries gets too big, classification directories will be added.
