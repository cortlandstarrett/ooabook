= OOA Book Initial Analysis

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This issue is raised to begin to analyze and plan the proposed report/book on
the Shlaer-Mellor method. Aims and objectives must be defined. A loose
outline/direction should be proposed.

== 2 Introduction and Background

See the `README` file at the root of this repository for more information.

== 3 Requirements

==== 3.1 Objectives shall be listed and discussed

==== 3.2 A straw man outline shall be proposed

==== 3.3 Next steps shall be laid out

== 4 Analysis

==== 4.1 Objectives and stake holders

The motivation for work on such a book as this has come from several different
business areas. The following are a (roughly ordered) list of objectives for
this book.

. Clarification of the method
  - Several elements are used in tooling but have never been described in the
    literature. It is time to catch up.
. Formalization of the method in xtUML
. Consolidation and broadening of the community
  - Seeding interest in a wider range of audiences (including academic
    audiences)

The following are ways stake holders gain value from such a book.

. One Fact
  .. One Fact is the number one supplier of services in the S-M community.
     Producing such a book strengthens and establishes One Fact as the steward
     for the method and confirms BridgePoint as the most definitive
     implementation of the method in use.
  .. Such a book enables One Fact to continue to lead growth and leadership in
     the xtUML user community.
  .. An OOA Book provides a well understood avenue for marketing the method to
     potential new users/S-M community members.
  .. Formalizing the method in literature helps to make critical decisions that
     will result in better, more consistent tooling.
. BridgePoint users
  .. The publication of such a book would streamline BridgePoint users in
     on-ramping new engineers with up to date information and best practices.
  .. Such a book when reviewed provides a platform for community based decisions
     on the direction of the tooling for the future.
  .. Literature will improve the understanding and effectiveness of existing
     users.
. Other xtUML/xUML users
  .. A book provides a common ground for users of all executable dialects to
     discuss the method and learn from one another.

==== 4.2 Outline

The following is a rough outline for the proposed book. This is subject to
change. As noted in <<dr-2>> section 3.3.2, chapters will not be ordered during
the writing of the book. Chapter ordering is a task best left till the end. As
such, the following outline is only partially ordered.

. Part 1: xtUML Method Report
  * Delayed accelerated event to self
  * System modeling
     - Components
       *** Component cardinality
     - Interfaces
     - Ports
       *** Polymorphic port
     - Messages
       *** Synchronous/asynchronous
       *** Returning values
       *** Mapping to class-based operations or functions
     - Deployments
  * Class-based state machines
  * Creation events
  * Collection types
  * Type system
  * Packaging
    - Package references
    - “Domain” packages
    - Packaging idioms and conventions
  * Error handling
    - Cannot happen
    - Exceptions
    - User defined exceptions
  * Action Language Dialects
    - OAL
    - MASL
    - ASL
    - Alf
  * Mellor-Balcer/Raistrick rationalization:
    - Polymorphic event
    - Baseless referentials
      *** Referential as identifier behavior
    - Final states
  * xtUML relationship with UML (as specified by OMG)
. Part 2: xtUML Tooling Survey
  * BridgePoint
    - Commentary on BridgePoint deviations from the method
  * iUML
    - TBD
  * MASL architecture, inspector
    - TBD
  * Others?
. Appendices
  * TBD

==== 4.3 Next steps

* Begin creating content/writing chapters
  - Capture questions, difficulties
  - Schedule meetings, stage reviews to resolve difficulties
  - Capture the process in documentation
  - Refine outline as necessary
* Read Mellor-Balcer: [.underline]#Executable UML: A Foundation for Model-Driven Architecture#
* Read Raistrick: [.underline]#Model Driven Architecture with Executable UML#
* Prepare an announcement to interested parties
  - Compile a list of potential contributors
  - Draft a note to introduce contributors to the repository and project
  - Consider inviting contributors little by little
