OOA / xtUML / xUML Report on the Methodology and Tooling

The Shlaer-Mellor Method dates back to the late '80s and early '90s
during the heat of the _Modeling Wars_.  xUML and xtUML were born out
of the Method as UML notation standardization swept the modeling landscape.
Books were written; tools were built and sold; methodology update reports
were produced...

Internet Globalization, an Open Source movement and other factors renovated
the rigorous and precise modeling and methodology arena.  The Method carried
on.  However, improvements in technique and tooling were documented mostly
by _de-facto_ implementations, specific engineering practices and tooling.
It is time for an OOA Book.

The _OOA Book_ will pick up where _Mellor Balcer_ and _Raistrick et al_ left
off.  This book will document the current state of the Method and the state
of being of the tooling.
